### What is flyball?

Flyball is a fast-paced dog sport that involves teams of four dogs racing against each other in a relay-style competition. Each dog must jump over a series of hurdles, trigger a spring-loaded box to release a tennis ball, catch the ball, and then return over the hurdles to their handler. The next dog then takes its turn, and the first team to have all four dogs complete the course without errors wins the heat. The sport is known for its excitement, speed, and the agility of the participating dogs, making it a popular activity for both dogs and their owners.
